# MyElevator
This is a simple program that takes a list of integers and then uses those as floor numbers to visit for an elevator.
Current implementation will output the floor numbers as they are visited, and then the return to the base floor.
Future implementation could include a button panel to get additional floor number from, as well as keeping track of the current
number of passengers and refusing entry when the elevator has reached capacity.
